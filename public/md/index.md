# UCLouvain **ICPC**

Welcome to UCLouvain ICPC!
This site is about everything related to [algorithmics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmics) at the [University of Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_catholique_de_Louvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve.

We routinely take part in (and organize!) algorithmics contests targeting all skill levels, as well as discuss clever solutions to these algorithmics problems.

## Why do algorithmics?

Here are a few reasons why taking part in algorithmics contests is a good idea:

- It's **fun**!
- You **learn** a lot by participating!
- **Teamwork**; it's cool.
- You (sometimes) receive **balloons** when you successfully complete a problem.
- Karaoke. Need I say more?
- It's a perfect addition to your **Tinder** profile!

## What is ICPC?

ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) is an algorithmics programming contest for university students.
Teams of three - representing their university - work to solve the most problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure.

## How does it work?

Here in Belgium there are 3 levels to go through before reaching the world finals:

- Pre-BAPC
- [BAPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAPC)
- [NWERC](https://2023.nwerc.eu/)
- World finals

Each contest has an average of 12 problems ranging from easy (-ish) to hard, though the NWERC is generally harder than the BAPC which is generally harder than the pre-BAPC.
Each problem has a time limit and a memory constraint, which your solution must execute within.

### When ?

- The Pre-BAPC & BAPC generally occur in October
- The NWERC occurs in late November or early December.

### Pre-BAPC & BAPC

The Pre-BAPC is a qualifying round which takes place in each university participating in the BAPC (in our case, [University Catholique de  Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_catholique_de_Louvain)).
The best teams will go on to participate in the BAPC.

BAPC (Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest) is a regional contest to determine which teams of the university will go to the NWERC.

### NWERC

NWERC (Northwestern Europe Regional Contest) is the contest where universities across Northwestern Europe compete for a spot in the ICPC world finals.
Generally it's the best 3 teams who go to the world finals.
Doing well in the BAPC isn't necessarily a prerequisite for being sent to the NWERC; that's a decision the university makes.

### World finals

World finals can take place anywhere around the world, and is the most prestigious of the contests.
The contest rules are the same as the NWERC and the BAPC, but the problem set tends to be harder than the NWERC.

## Training

Each week, our beloved coach Henri prepares a weekly contest on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/).
Every Thursday at lunchtime we discuss the problems and solutions together.

There are a lot of resources to learn competitive programming.
Some website even host online contests to train on.

Here are a few of them:
 
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/)
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/)

There are also books from which you can learn the basics:
