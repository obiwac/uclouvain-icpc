# UCLouvain **ICPC**

Welcome to UCLouvain ICPC!
This site is about everything related to [algorithmics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmics) at the [University of Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_catholique_de_Louvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve.

We routinely take part in (and organize!) algorithmics contests targeting all skill levels, as well as discuss clever solutions to these algorithmics problems.

## Why do algorithmics?

Here are a few reasons why taking part in algorithmics contests is a good idea:

- It's **fun**!
- You **learn** a lot by participating!
- **Teamwork**; it's cool.
- You (sometimes) receive **balloons** when you successfully complete a problem.
- Karaoke. Need I say more?
- It's a perfect addition to your **Tinder** profile!

## What is ICPC?

ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) is an algorithmics programming contest for university students.
Teams of three - representing their university - work to solve the most problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure.

## How does it work?

Here in Belgium there are 3 levels to go through before reaching the world finals:

- preBAPC
- BAPC
- NWERC
- World finals

### BAPC
BAPC stands for Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest

### NWERC

NWERC (Northwestern Europe Regional Contest).

### Worlds Finals
