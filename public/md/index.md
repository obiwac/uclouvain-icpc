# UCLouvain **ICPC**

Welcome to UCLouvain ICPC!
This site is about everything related to [algorithmics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmics) at the [University of Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_catholique_de_Louvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve.

We routinely take part in (and organize!) algorithmics contests targeting all skill levels, as well as discuss clever solutions to these algorithmics problems.

## Why do algorithmics?

Here are a few reasons why taking part in algorithmics contests is a good idea:

- It's **fun**!
- You **learn** a lot by participating!
- **Teamwork**; it's cool.
- You (sometimes) receive **balloons** when you successfully complete a problem.
- Karaoke. Need I say more?
- It's a perfect addition to your **Tinder** profile!

## What is ICPC?

ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) is an algorithmics programming contest for university students.
Teams of three - representing their university - work to solve the most problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure.

## How does it work?

Here in Belgium there are 3 levels to go through before reaching the world finals:

- Pre-BAPC
- [BAPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAPC)
- [NWERC](https://2023.nwerc.eu/)
- World finals

Each contest has an average of 12 problems ranging from easy (-ish) to hard, though the NWERC is generally harder than the BAPC which is generally harder than the pre-BAPC.
Each problem has a time limit and a memory constraint, which your solution must execute within.

### When ?
- Pre-BAPC & BAPC generally occurs in october
- NWERC occurs in late november or early december.


### Pre-BAPC & BAPC

The Pre-BAPC is a qualifying round which takes place in each university participating in the BAPC (in our case, [University Catholique de  Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_catholique_de_Louvain)).
The best teams will go on to participate in the BAPC.

BAPC (Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest) is a regional contest to determine which teams of the university will go to the NWERC.

### NWERC

NWERC (Northwestern Europe Regional Contest) is the contest where universities across Northwestern Europe compete for a spot in the ICPC world finals.
Generally it's the best 3 teams who go to the world finals.
Doing well in the BAPC isn't necessarily a prerequisite for being sent to the NWERC; that's a decision the university makes.

### World finals

World finals take place all around the world, it is the most presigious contest. Contest rules are the same as NWERC & BAPC.
Problem set tends to be more difficult than NWERC.


## Training

Each week, our beloved coach Henri prepares a weekly contest on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/).
Every Thursday at lunchtime we discuss the problems and solutions together.

There is a lot of ressources to learn competitive programming, some website handle online contest to train : 
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/)
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/)

There is also books where you can lean the basis
