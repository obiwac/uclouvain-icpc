# UCLouvain **ICPC**

Welcome to UCLouvain ICPC!
This site is about everything related to [algorithmics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmics) at the [University of Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_catholique_de_Louvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve.

We routinely take part in (and organize!) algorithmics contests targeting all skill levels, as well as discuss clever solutions to these algorithmics problems.

## Why do algorithmics?

Here are a few reasons why taking part in algorithmics contests is a good idea:

- It's **fun**!
- You **learn** a lot by participating!
- **Teamwork**; it's cool.
- You (sometimes) receive **balloons** when you successfully complete a problem.
- Karaoke. Need I say more?
- It's a perfect addition to your **Tinder** profile!

## What is ICPC?

ICPC stands for International Collegiate Programming Contest. It is an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure.

## How it works ? 
There is multiple levels of competition. Here in Belgium there is 3 levels:
- BAPC
- NWERC
- Worlds Finals

### BAPC
BAPC stands for Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest

### NWERC
NWERC stands for Northwestern Europe Regional Contest

### Worlds Finals
